<h1 style="color:red" font=""><u>Pets</u></h1>
<p><b>A pet, or companion animal,</b> is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory <br>
animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an <br>
altruistic basis <font size="+1">(such as a stray animal)</font> and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.<br><br><br>

Two of the most popular pets are<del> dogs and cats.</del> Other animals commonly kept include <font color="Blue";>rabbits;ferrets; pigs; rodents such as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats,<br>
 mice, and guinea pigs; birds such as parrots, passerines, and fowls; reptiles such as turtles, lizards, snakes, and iguanas; aquatic pets such as fish, freshwater snails,<br>
 and saltwater snails; amphibians such as frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets such as tarantulas and hermit crabs.</font> Small pets may be grouped together as <br>
pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.

<p><mark><tt>Pets provide their owners, or guardians,[1] both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with exercise,<br>
 fresh air, and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social <br>
interaction with other people. There is a medically approved class of therapy animals that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children<br>
 in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive, or<br>
 emotional goals with patients.</tt></mark></p>
