<h2><b><i>Languages of Sri Lanka</I></B></H2>
<hr/>
<p><mark>Sinhala (also called Sinhalese or Sinhalese)</mark> is the mother tongue of the Sinhalese ethnic group which is the largest in Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan<br>
 branch of the Indo-European languages. <br><br>
<mark>Sinhala</mark> is spoken by about 16 million people in Sri Lanka, about 13 million of who are native speakers. It is one of the constitutionally-recognised official<br> 
languages of Sri Lanka, along with Tamil, which has its origins in South India. <br><br>
Most Sri Lankans can speak <mark>English,</mark> though of course, their brand of English may sound a bit strange at first. Some struggle with English and that is sometimes<br>
 due to a lack of confidence. Just enjoy the experience, if you can learn a little of Sinhala. The Sinhalese will go out of their way to help you because you have gone<br>
 out of your way to learn their language, their most cherished possession and symbol of identity.
